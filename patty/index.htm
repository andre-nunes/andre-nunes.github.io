  <div class = "button2"> <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Even though I come from an artistic background I have always liked the idea of solving a problem. Architecture deals with this since it is always trying to create a better setting to solve a social or environmental problem, but I found that the answer it’s not always correct and even when it’s completely wrong if it has already been built there’s little chance that it can be improved, altered or demolished. With coding the polar opposite is true. Code either works or it doesn’t and when it doesn’t there’s a million possibilities you can try to make it work better, even after completion. Now that I understand the relevance of IT in our daily lifes, how impactful it is today and much it is growing I have come to the conclusion that I want to be a part of this area.">Why do I want to become a Developer?</a> </div>
  <div class = "button1"> <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="My journey in the world of programing started when I was still at University studying Architecture. I was in my third year and had to do a project for a class called Programing for architecture. There I learnt my first language - Racket. This language is relatively simple, it receives functions with one or more parameters inside of which it is possible to apply several methods (math, conditions, loops, randomness, iteration, ... ). The most interesting thing about this language is that I used it with a plug-in (created by the Teacher) that allowed the code to be read in AutoCAD and translated into 2D and 3D graphics. As a first experience this was great but in the end I didn’t get a great grade and it was hard to understand intangible concepts or fully understand coding structure when I was in the middle of learning about architecture, a very tangible field. About three years later, having finished my course and inspired by some peers from engineering I decided to start learning Python. I choose this language because it was similar to first one I had learnt and also because I had done a little research and it seemed to be intuitive and therefore easy to learn. So I created a profile in codeacademy.com and started earning badgets as I progressed. In November 2017, once I was more familiarized with the logic of programing I entered myself in an event called “5 Day Coding Challenge” organized by the Code Institute. During that week I had my first contact with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had to spend 15 minutes of my day watching an informative video and then solving exercises. It was a great way to understand more about the core of Front-end Development, how these three languages interact and complete each other. However this was just an introduction and not having the means to enlist myself in a Code Institute course I decided to go back to codeacademy and I also subscribe for a free month trial of Lynda so I could learn more about Web Development. I think I still have a lot to learn but I do believe that these steps have given me stable foundations for progress.">My journey so far...</a> </div>
