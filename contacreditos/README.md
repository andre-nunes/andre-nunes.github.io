ContaCreditos
========

The Bologna Process aims to regulate European College degree's, one of the limits it imposes is that each student cannot enroll on more that 40.5 ECTS (credits given by courses) per semester. 

I developed a small tool to help my colleagues decide which courses to enrol in each semester.

So far it as all the courses for the Degree (Bsc) in Information Systems and Computer Engineering but I hope to expand it to support further Degrees.
