{"name":"andre-nunes","tagline":"coding for people","body":"### Background\r\nI'm a twenty something developer currently based in Lisbon. Almost graduated in Information Systems and Computer Engineering (BSc) from [TÃ©cnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).\r\n \r\nAddicted to Java (the programming language, JavaScript and the coffee beans). I've been gradually moving from Back-end into Front-end development, manly due to my current job at [FenixEdu](http://fenixedu.org/) which is an open source academic management application used by the University of Lisbon and due to my contributions to [Cesiumjs](http://cesiumjs.org/) which is an open source JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and 2D maps in a web browser without a plugin.\r\n\r\n### Work experience\r\n#### 2012-2013 System Administrator at [RNL](https://rnl.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) (Scientific Introduction Fellowship).\r\n\r\nStarted from the bottom (of the stack) now I'm here... no but in all honesty it was a great experience, I worked in a team of 6 _sysAdmins_ and apart from technical skills I've also learned important skills such as how to collaborate with others and how to deal with clients (students and teachers in this case). \r\n\r\nThe best thing I've learned was that despite having a big interest in this area (networking, administration Linux and Windows servers) this was not something I'd like to spend my life doing so I moved on to the developing side...\r\n\r\n**Technologies**: shell, bash, DNS, DHCP, Windows Server, Microsoft Server Application Virtualization, Active Directory\r\n\r\n#### 2014-now Junior Developer at [FenixEdu](http://fenixedu.org/)\r\nCurrently working as a Junior Dev and loving every moment of it. It's great to work with such experienced developers and learn so much from them. I deal mostly with code maintenance and development of small new features in the web application. It's challenging and exciting to work in such a big and old code base, check our [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/FenixEdu/fenixedu-academic)\r\n\r\n**Technologies**: Java, git, mvn, Apache Struts, Spring, JavaScript, JSP, angular.js\r\n\r\n### Open Source contributions\r\nI try contributing to open source as much as I can. I've participated in the last three editions of [Google Summer Of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) which is a global program that offers student developers ages 18 and older stipends to write code for various open source software projects.\r\n\r\n_For more info and detailed descriptions please check my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/andregomesnunes) and/or my [CV]()_","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
