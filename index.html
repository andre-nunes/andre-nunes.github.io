<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>I'm a twenty something developer currently based in Lisbon. Soon to be graduated in Information Systems and Computer Engineering (BSc) from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">TÃ©cnico Lisboa</a>.</p>

<p>Addicted to Java (the programming language, JavaScript and the coffee beans). I've been gradually moving from Back-end into Front-end development, manly due to my job at <a href="http://fenixedu.org/">FenixEdu</a> which is an open source academic management application used by the University of Lisbon and due to my contributions to <a href="http://cesiumjs.org/">Cesiumjs</a>, an open source JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and 2D maps in a web browser without a plugin.</p>

<p>Started from the bottom (of the stack) now I'm here... no but in all honesty it was a great experience, I worked in a team of 6 <em>sysAdmins</em> and apart from technical skills I've also learned important skills such as how to collaborate with others and how to deal with clients (students and teachers in this case). </p>

<p>The best thing I've learned was that despite having a big interest in this area (networking, administration Linux and Windows servers) this was not something I'd like to spend my life doing so I moved on to the developing side...</p>

<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: shell, bash, DNS, DHCP, Windows Server, Microsoft Server Application Virtualization, Active Directory</p>

</h4>

<p>Worked as a Junior Dev and loved every moment of it. It was great to work with such experienced developers and learn so much from them. I dealt mostly with code maintenance and development of small new features in the web application. It was challenging and exciting to work in such a big and old code base, check our <a href="https://github.com/FenixEdu/fenixedu-academic">repository on GitHub</a></p>

<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Java, git, mvn, Apache Struts, Spring, JavaScript, JSP, angular.js</p>

<a id="open-source-contributions" class="anchor" href="#open-source-contributions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Source contributions</h3>

<p>I try contributing to open source as much as I can. I've participated in the last three editions of <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google Summer Of Code</a> which is a global program that offers student developers ages 18 and older stipends to write code for various open source software projects.</p>
